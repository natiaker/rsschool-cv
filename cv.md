### About me

Highly motivated entry level Front-end developer, who isable to build responsive web pages with basic knowledgein HTML5/CSS3, Javascript and willing to learn more and became successful in this field.

Also, I have a basic knowledge in jQuery, git and small experience in Javascript's framework Vue.js

Now I'm taking a New Horizons Course: JavaScript and Front End Frameworks. After that I'm going to take an international Information Technology Specialist certification test in JavaScript.

I graduated from high school physics and mathematics in 2016 and also got Bachelor degree in Electronics Engineering in 2020. 
I love Technical subjects from my childhood and keen on to continue studying and master the most popular and required profession today. I'm obsessed with drawing and graphic design too, so building designed webpage with technical skills is incredible for me and the best way to use my both - technical and artistic skills. 

When I heard about Rs school I was happy, because I think it will give me a great education in Front-end developement and I will be able to improve my self-studying, also interview skills and a good opportunity to get a job in one of the world's largest company as a FE developer.
